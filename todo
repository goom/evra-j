Need to reformat classes.json:
-The autolevel array should be an array with objects containing all the subobjects/arrays and the level, rather than an object called 'feature' with an object 'level'.

Need to set the TextField as the initially selected field, and add up/down arrow hotkeys for command history.
Also need to look into modifying the search results to use HTML for readability
