This is a Java version of the other Evra project I was working on. Got frustrated with having to build my own infrastructure in C++ so I'm switching to a higher level language. Hopefully Java treats me better (it has so far).

Not caught up completely yet, only have the basic math functions in place at the moment, but I have a user interface!
